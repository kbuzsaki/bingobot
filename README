This is an IRC bot for the ZeldaSpeedRuns BingoLeague to be hosted on SpeedRunsLive.

Todo List:
    - Nicer feedback message when looking someone up for the first time
    - Have messages over the message limit be sent in multiple chunks
    - "detailed" mode for times that includes timestamp + url
    - beforeData and afterDate parameters
    - fix !rate and !teamtime to be more accurate
    - !median to complement !average
